Whether it’s the beauty, or something else we can’t exactly put our finger on, mountains inspire us!  If you’re looking for a little inspiration for your family this fall, then consider heading to Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.",

However, I really want to encourage you to not completely overload yourself.",

Because tucked into this large bill are items that are critically important to the entire hiking community': items such as permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) and also funding to address the constant borrowing from Forest Service programs in order to pay for the increasing costs of wildfire suppression.",

It is a rugged alternate to the John Muir Trail (JMT), boasting about 100 miles of cross-country travel, numerous Class III scrambles, and seemingly endless miles of boulder fields. SHR hikers are rewarded with pristine alpine settings, uninterrupted stretches of solitude, and a sense of true adventure. The route was developed by climber Steve Roper back in the late-1970’s.",
